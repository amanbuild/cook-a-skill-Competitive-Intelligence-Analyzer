# Skill Card — Competitive Intelligence Skill

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Skill Name** | **Competitive Intelligence Skill** |
| **What it automates** | Automatically generates a **competitive intelligence report** from a product spec: identifies active competitors, collects public competitor data, compares them using standardized criteria, and synthesizes strategic insights (whitespace, threats, action items). |
| **BEFORE: Manual process** | The team has to manually research competitors one by one, gather fragmented data, compare information across different sources, and often misses important competitor features. It also takes significant time to assess each competitor’s strengths and weaknesses. Usually, it takes **2–3 days** to produce one reasonably usable report. |
| **AFTER: With the skill** | Users only need to prepare a product brief and run the skill prompt. The AI then executes the workflow automatically: parse spec → discover competitors → deep dive → synthesis → output a complete markdown report. Total time is reduced to around **~5 minutes of AI research + user review**. |
| **Tools / AI used** | Claude, ChatGPT |
| **Limitations** | Depends on public data availability; if data is missing, it must be marked as **Unknown**. It also cannot yet use APIs for the most up-to-date and precise metrics. For example, AI-based Similarweb or X (Twitter) search may be blocked, and if the product spec is too generic, it becomes difficult to identify the right competitors. Grok integration can help validate social metrics and traction signals in more detail. |
| **Expansion Roadmap** | Integrate direct APIs for deeper and more accurate analysis, and connect Grok (or similar tools) for richer social/traction validation—making planning more detailed and decision-making easier. |
