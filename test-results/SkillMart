# SkillMart — Competitive Intelligence Report
**February 2026**

> **Executive Summary:** The "skill marketplace" space is bifurcating into two parallel ecosystems: (1) **AI Agent Skills** — free, developer-focused registries for SKILL.md-format packages (SkillsMP, skills.sh, ClawHub, SkillHub.club, LobeHub), and (2) **Prompt/Workflow Marketplaces** — monetized platforms for buying/selling prompts, templates, and automation assets (PromptBase, AIPRM, FlowGPT, ProBazaar, Gumroad/Etsy). SkillMart's vision sits at the intersection: a *paid* marketplace with *runnable, versioned, maintainable* skills. No current player occupies this exact position — this is both an opportunity and a risk (the gap may indicate a market-creation challenge). Critical threats include: open-source skill registries commoditizing free content, and AI models getting smart enough to replace static prompts. The biggest whitespace is **trust + team licensing + versioning for paid workflow assets** — a space nobody owns yet.

## 3. Deep Dives: Positioning vs. Execution

### 3.1 SkillsMP (skillsmp.com)

**Layer A — Positioning (what they SAY):**
- **Stated ICP:** Developers and AI coding assistant users (Claude Code, Codex CLI, ChatGPT users)
- **USP:** "The largest free marketplace for agent skills" — discovery layer on top of GitHub's skill repos
- **Narrative:** Democratize access to the SKILL.md standard; aggregate the fragmented skill ecosystem

**Layer B — Execution (what they DO):**
- **Traction:** 66,541–96,751 skills indexed as of Jan 2026 [A — official site]. Monthly traffic 327K–1.24M depending on source (as of Jan 2026) [B — MOGE/Aitoolnet]. Recognized by Anthropic and LangChain. Has an X/Twitter community and a Solana token ($SKILLSMP)
- **Product depth:** Semantic AI search, category filtering, GitHub sync for updates, one-command installation. No built-in execution — skills run in your local agent. No quality curation beyond GitHub stars (min 2 stars to be listed)
- **Monetization:** Free. Donation-supported community project. Not affiliated with Anthropic. No paid tier found
- **Distribution:** Organic SEO, GitHub ecosystem, AI tool directories, community word-of-mouth, crypto community

**Strengths (from external sources):**
- 🗣️ Community says: Praised as the de facto discovery layer for agent skills — "The first real marketplace for agent skills is already live" — source: Medium/The Context Layer, Dec 2025 [C]
- 🧠 Expert says: SmartScope published a comprehensive SDLC-based guide to using SkillsMP skills — treating it as the canonical resource — source: smartscope.blog, Jan 2026 [C]

**Weaknesses (from external sources):**
- 🧠 Expert says: Security researchers found 5.2% of skills analyzed showed patterns suggesting malicious intent — source: arXiv:2601.10338, Jan 2026 [B]
- 🗣️ Community says: No quality curation beyond star count; volume overwhelms signal — Inference: most users likely need external guidance to pick the right skill

**So what?** SkillsMP is the volume leader but has zero monetization, zero quality assurance, and zero team/licensing features. SkillMart can differentiate on every axis SkillsMP deliberately ignores: paid quality, trust, creator tooling, and enterprise licensing.

---

### 3.2 SkillHub.club (skillhub.club)

**Layer A — Positioning (what they SAY):**
- **Stated ICP:** AI developers using Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode
- **USP:** "7,000+ AI-evaluated skills" with a 5-dimension scoring system (Practicality, Clarity, Automation, Quality, Impact) and an in-browser Playground
- **Narrative:** Quality over quantity — AI-scored rankings replace star-count proxy

**Layer B — Execution (what they DO):**
- **Traction:** 7K–9.5K skills as of Jan–Feb 2026 [A — official site]. Desktop app available. API with SDK. GitHub org shows active development (last commits Jan 2026) [A]
- **Product depth:** AI-evaluated quality scoring (S/A/B ranks), Playground for instant testing, "Stacks" (bundled skill combinations), desktop app for managing skills across agents, MCP server integration, API with 60–100 RPM rate limits
- **Monetization:** Freemium — free browsing and basic use; "Pro" for premium stacks/bundles. Also offers API proxy to Claude (using SkillHub credits or BYOK). Pricing details not fully public [HR-3: not publicly disclosed beyond freemium]
- **Distribution:** GitHub indexing, SEO, word-of-mouth, desktop app distribution

**Strengths (from external sources):**
- 📰 News: Active shipping velocity — desktop app, MCP server, SDK, API all launched within weeks in Jan 2026 — source: GitHub/skillhub-club, Jan 2026 [A]
- No community/expert reviews found beyond directory listings — "No expert review data found."

**Weaknesses (from external sources):**
- 🗣️ Community: No independent community reviews found. Small catalog (7–9.5K vs. SkillsMP's 66–96K). Inference: May struggle for discovery traction against volume leaders
- No news coverage found beyond AI tool directories

**So what?** SkillHub.club is the closest conceptual competitor to SkillMart — it's trying to add quality scoring and a Pro tier to the agent skills ecosystem. However, it's developer-only, has no creator monetization, no team licensing, and no trust/verification beyond AI scoring. SkillMart's human trust signals (reviews, proof-of-use, buyer protection) and creator economics would be the differentiator.

### 3.3 skills.sh (Vercel)

**Layer A — Positioning (what they SAY):**
- **Stated ICP:** Developers using AI coding agents (18+ agent tools supported)
- **USP:** "npm for AI agents" — standardized CLI-based skill installation across all major AI agents
- **Narrative:** Open ecosystem for agent commands; composability over protocol complexity

**Layer B — Execution (what they DO):**
- **Traction:** Launched Jan 20, 2026 [A — Vercel changelog]. Top skill has 26K+ all-time installs as of Jan 2026 [B]. CLI used across 17+ agent platforms. "Tens of thousands of installs shortly after launch" [B — InfoQ]
- **Product depth:** CLI (`npx skills add <package>`), leaderboard with trending/all-time views, basic category filtering, telemetry-based install counts. No execution sandbox, no quality review
- **Monetization:** Free. Vercel-backed infrastructure play — skills drive Vercel platform adoption
- **Distribution:** Vercel's existing developer audience, InfoQ/HN coverage, cross-agent CLI compatibility

**Strengths (from external sources):**
- 🧠 Expert says: InfoQ described it as addressing a "key challenge in the AI agent ecosystem: discovering and sharing procedural knowledge" — source: InfoQ, Feb 2026 [B]
- 🗣️ Community says: Guillermo Rauch (Vercel CEO) noted "industry response exceeded my expectations" — source: X/@rauchg, Jan 2026 [C]

**Weaknesses (from external sources):**
- 🗣️ Community says: "80% of skills in skills.sh are AI slop. Go for the vendor-provided ones" — source: @pablocubico on X, Jan 2026 [C]
- 🧠 Expert says: "No quality control. Anyone can create a skill. The only ranking mechanism is install count—which can be gamed" — source: vibecoding.app review, Jan 2026 [C]

**So what?** Vercel's backing gives skills.sh credibility and cross-platform reach, but its "no quality control" stance is a strategic decision (developer responsibility model). SkillMart's trust layer directly addresses the quality gap that users are already complaining about. The risk: Vercel could add paid/premium tiers later.

---

### 3.4 PromptBase (promptbase.com)

**Layer A — Positioning (what they SAY):**
- **Stated ICP:** Content creators, digital marketers, AI artists, small businesses, and prompt engineers selling their work
- **USP:** "The #1 marketplace for AI prompts" — buy and sell curated prompts across models
- **Narrative:** Prompts as digital products; creator economy for AI content

**Layer B — Execution (what they DO):**
- **Traction:** 210K+ prompts; 260K+ claimed on site [A]. Monthly traffic 525K (Sep 2025) to 677K (Jan 2026) [B — SimilarWeb/MOGE]. 80% seller revenue share. 2,100+ free prompts. Global rank ~81K [B — SimilarWeb]. ⚠️ Traffic data is ~5 months old for the SimilarWeb data point
- **Product depth:** Prompt listings with previews, model-specific filtering (ChatGPT, Midjourney, DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, Veo), no-code App Builder, Stable Diffusion image generation credits, Stripe seller payments, embeddable apps
- **Monetization:** 20% commission on sales, 10% on custom work, 0% on self-referred sales [B]. Price range $1.99–$9.99 per prompt [B]
- **Distribution:** SEO (branded searches dominate), referral from AI platforms (11K visits from ChatGPT as of Sep 2025), cross-listing with Etsy/Fiverr/Gumroad

**Strengths (from external sources):**
- 🧠 Expert says: "The most well-known AI prompt marketplace" — consistently ranked #1 in every prompt marketplace comparison — source: multiple reviews (HIX.AI, Panstag, Writesonic) [B/C]
- 📰 News: Global AI prompt marketplace market valued at $1.4B in 2024, growing at ~26% CAGR — source: Grand View Research, Dec 2025 [B]

**Weaknesses (from external sources):**
- 🗣️ Community says: "Quality can vary. PromptBase's refund policy and third-party reviews show how often prompts underperform or break when models update" — source: MWXToken analysis, Dec 2025 [C]
- 🧠 Expert says: "Prompts are just static text strings — no versioning, no updates when models change, no execution" — Inference: this is PromptBase's structural limitation that SkillMart directly solves

**So what?** PromptBase proves the paid-prompt market works but is stuck in the "static text string" era. No versioning, no update lifecycle, no team licensing, and quality is buyer-beware. SkillMart's versioned, runnable skills with trust signals are a generation ahead — but PromptBase has the brand and the traffic. The play is to capture PromptBase's higher-intent segment (operators/founders who want *execution*, not just prompts).

---

### 3.5 ClawHub (clawhub.ai)

**Layer A — Positioning (what they SAY):**
- **Stated ICP:** OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot) users — developers and power users building personal AI agents
- **USP:** "Skill dock for agent extensions" — npm-style registry with semantic search and CLI installation
- **Narrative:** Modular AI; extend your agent with community-built capabilities

**Layer B — Execution (what they DO):**
- **Traction:** 10,700+ skills as of Feb 2026 [B — Awesome Agents]. Snyk scanned 3,984 skills as of Feb 5, 2026 [B]. ClawHub is embedded in OpenClaw's rapidly growing ecosystem (OpenClaw has viral adoption per multiple security analyses)
- **Product depth:** Semver versioning, changelogs, vector (semantic) search, CLI installation (`clawhub install <skill-name>`). Recently added VirusTotal integration for security scanning
- **Monetization:** Free, open-source. No paid tier
- **Distribution:** Part of the OpenClaw ecosystem — users find skills as part of their agent setup

**Strengths (from external sources):**
- 🧠 Expert says: "Snyk frames ClawHub as the 'npm registry for AI agents'" — source: Snyk ToxicSkills study, Feb 2026 [B]
- 📰 News: OpenClaw's creator partnered with VirusTotal to add security scanning — source: Aikido.dev, Feb 2026 [B]

**Weaknesses (from external sources):**
- 🧠 Expert says: 341–824 malicious skills identified, including credential theft, crypto-stealing malware, and reverse shells. "If you have interacted with ClawHub CLI skills, assume your host machine is compromised" — source: Snyk, Feb 2026 [B]
- 📰 News: "The #1 skill on OpenClaw's Marketplace Was Malware" — ranking was faked, skill had 9 vulnerabilities — source: Awesome Agents, Feb 2026 [B]
- 🗣️ Community says: HN comments note "people are willing to sacrifice security for AI assistance" — source: HN, Feb 2026 [C]

**So what?** ClawHub is a cautionary tale: *what happens when a skill marketplace has no trust layer*. It validates SkillMart's thesis that trust, verification, and buyer protection are essential — not nice-to-haves. SkillMart should reference ClawHub's security crisis in its positioning as a reason trust matters. However, ClawHub is also proof of explosive demand for skill distribution.

---

## 4. Who's Winning & Why

### SkillsMP — Winning on: Volume + Network Effects
SkillsMP dominates through sheer catalog size (66K–96K skills) and first-mover indexing of the SKILL.md ecosystem. Its GitHub-sync model means it automatically grows as the community publishes. Recognized by both Anthropic and LangChain, giving it institutional legitimacy.
**So what?** Volume is SkillsMP's moat, but it's a *free* moat — no revenue model, no creator incentives, no quality curation. SkillMart cannot win on volume against a free aggregator. Instead, win on *curated quality and monetizable trust*.

### skills.sh — Winning on: Platform Backing + Cross-Agent Distribution
Vercel's skills.sh launched just 5 weeks ago and already has tens of thousands of installs across 17+ agent platforms. The CLI (`npx skills add`) makes installation frictionless. Vercel's brand and developer audience provide instant distribution.
**So what?** This is the most dangerous structural competitor because Vercel can add premium tiers, marketplace features, or acquisition-absorb any indie competitor. Watch their roadmap closely.

### PromptBase — Winning on: Monetization Proof + Brand
PromptBase is the only scaled marketplace that proves people *will pay* for prompts ($1.99–$9.99). It has 210K+ prompts, ~600K monthly traffic, and 80% seller revenue share. The brand "PromptBase" is synonymous with prompt commerce.
**So what?** PromptBase validates the market but hasn't evolved beyond static prompts. SkillMart's opportunity is to be the "PromptBase for the SKILL.md era" — adding versioning, runnability, and team licensing to the proven prompt-commerce model.

### SkillHub.club — Winning on: Quality Signal Innovation
SkillHub.club's AI-evaluated scoring system (5 dimensions, S/A/B ranking) is the most sophisticated quality signal in the ecosystem. The Playground for instant testing is a differentiator no other marketplace offers.
**So what?** Quality scoring + testing is the right direction, but AI scoring alone may not build buyer trust. SkillMart should combine AI scoring with human reviews and proof-of-use outcomes for a trust layer that's both scalable and credible.

### ClawHub — Winning on: Ecosystem Lock-In (despite security crisis)
ClawHub's advantage is being embedded in OpenClaw — a rapidly-adopted personal AI agent platform. Users don't *choose* ClawHub; they *end up there* because it's the default skill registry.
**So what?** Ecosystem lock-in is the strongest distribution moat. SkillMart should pursue integration partnerships with major AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot) rather than trying to build audience from scratch.

---

## 5. Strategic Whitespace

### Whitespace 1: Paid, Trusted Marketplace for Runnable Skills (Primary Opportunity)

**Gap:** Every agent-skills marketplace (SkillsMP, skills.sh, ClawHub, LobeHub) is free, open-source, and has minimal quality control. Every paid marketplace (PromptBase, Gumroad, AIPRM) sells static, non-versioned text with no trust layer. *Nobody sells trusted, versioned, runnable skills with buyer protection and team licensing.*

**Who to target:** Ops leads, growth teams, and agency founders (annual spend $50–500/seat on productivity tools) who need *reliable, maintained* workflow modules — not DIY GitHub repos.

**What to build:**
- Verified skill listings with structured inputs/outputs, demo runs, and version history
- Buyer protection: money-back if skill doesn't meet spec; structured "proof-of-use" outcomes
- Team licensing: per-seat pricing, org-level permissions, shared skill libraries
- Creator analytics: funnel metrics, A/B pricing, affiliate tools

**Why winnable:** Free registries have no incentive to build trust infrastructure (it's expensive, and their model is volume). Prompt marketplaces are architecturally stuck in the "text string" paradigm. SkillMart can own this gap before a well-funded player (Vercel, Anthropic) decides to add commerce.

**Timeline:** 3–6 months to MVP with 100–500 high-quality curated skills, trust layer, and team licensing.

---

### Whitespace 2: Non-Developer Skill Marketplace (Secondary Opportunity)

**Gap:** All agent-skills marketplaces (SkillsMP, skills.sh, ClawHub) serve *developers* who use CLI tools and code editors. SkillMart's stated ICP includes operators, marketers, analysts, and founders who want to "buy execution, not advice." No marketplace serves this audience with AI workflow modules.

**Who to target:** Marketing ops, sales ops, content teams, and solo founders who use ChatGPT/Claude daily but don't touch CLI tools.

**What to build:**
- One-click export/import to ChatGPT, Claude.ai, Notion, Zapier, Make — no terminal required
- "Copy prompt" UX (like PromptBase) *plus* structured workflow packaging (inputs/outputs/requirements)
- Use-case-driven categories: "Content Marketing Kit," "Investor Update Workflow," "Competitive Analysis Playbook"

**Why winnable:** Developers are already served by free tools. The non-developer ops/business audience has *no dedicated marketplace* for runnable AI workflows — only generic platforms (Gumroad, Etsy) with zero quality assurance.

**Timeline:** Layer on top of Whitespace 1 MVP. 6–9 months for non-developer UX and integration partnerships.

---

### Whitespace 3: Trust-as-a-Differentiator (Security Positioning)

**Gap:** ClawHub's malware crisis (341–824 malicious skills) and skills.sh's quality problems ("80% AI slop") have created a trust vacuum. Security researchers (Snyk, Koi) are raising alarms about skill supply chain attacks. No marketplace has responded with a credible trust layer.

**Who to target:** Enterprise/agency buyers who need to justify tool purchases, and security-conscious teams.

**What to build:**
- Multi-layer verification: automated security scanning + human review + structured testing
- "Verified Publisher" badges, dispute resolution, refund-safe access gating
- Compliance-ready audit trails (version history, access logs, license tracking)

**Why winnable:** Trust infrastructure is expensive and unglamorous — free/open-source projects won't build it. SkillMart can use trust as the primary positioning differentiator: "The only skill marketplace you can trust."

**Timeline:** Bake into v1. Security scanning and verification at launch; compliance features in 6–12 months.

## 6. Threats & Risk Signals

| # | Threat | Severity | Source | Mitigation |
|---|--------|----------|--------|-----------|
| T-1 | **AI models replace static skills.** As models get smarter (GPT-5, Claude 4.5), they may generate on-the-fly what today's skills package as static assets. The value of buying a "prompt" diminishes. | 🔴 **Critical** | Structural trend; GPT-5 release trajectory. Inference: model capability curve threatens the "skill-as-product" concept long-term. | Invest in *dynamic* skills: workflows with living data, multi-step automations, integrations — things models can't generate spontaneously. Avoid competing on commodity prompts. |
| T-2 | **Vercel adds commerce to skills.sh.** Vercel has the distribution (17+ agents), the brand, the engineering team, and the VC backing to add paid tiers, creator monetization, and team licensing. | 🟡 High | Vercel changelog, Jan 2026 [A]. Inference: a marketplace layer is a natural extension. | Move fast. Establish trust layer and creator community before Vercel pivots. Build differentiation on non-developer UX and trust signals that Vercel's dev-focused DNA won't prioritize. |
| T-3 | **Anthropic or OpenAI build an official skill store.** Both companies defined the SKILL.md standard and have direct access to all users. An official store would be a category-killer. | 🟡 High | Anthropic published Agent Skills spec Dec 2025 [A]. OpenAI GPT Store precedent [A]. | Differentiate on cross-platform compatibility, creator economics, and trust. An official store would likely be single-platform; SkillMart should be multi-agent. |
| T-4 | **Supply chain security incidents damage the category.** ClawHub's malware crisis could generalize to "skill marketplaces are dangerous." | 🟡 Medium | Snyk ToxicSkills study, Feb 2026 [B]; multiple media reports [B]. | Proactively invest in security; use the crisis in positioning ("learn from ClawHub's mistakes"). Launch with security scanning from day one. |
| T-5 | **Prompt marketplace fatigue.** PromptBase's traffic is declining slightly (down ~5.75% MoM, Sep 2025 [B]). The "sell prompts" narrative may be losing novelty. | 🟡 Medium | SimilarWeb data, Sep 2025 [B]. ⚠️ Older — ~5 months. | Position as "skills, not prompts." The SKILL.md format is substantively different from static prompts. Differentiate messaging clearly. |

## 7. Action Items & Watchlist

### Build
- **Trust layer (P0, 0–3 months):** Implement automated security scanning (partner with Snyk or VirusTotal), human review for featured/verified skills, structured proof-of-use outcomes, and buyer protection (refund-safe gating). This is the #1 differentiator.
- **Creator monetization (P0, 0–3 months):** 80%+ rev share (match PromptBase), analytics dashboard, bundle/discount tools, A/B pricing experiments. The creator flywheel is essential for supply.
- **Team licensing (P1, 3–6 months):** Per-seat pricing, org-level permissions, shared skill libraries, admin dashboards. No competitor offers this — first-mover advantage.
- **Non-developer UX (P1, 3–6 months):** One-click export to ChatGPT/Claude.ai/Notion/Zapier/Make. Use-case-driven categories. "Zero-CLI" installation and usage.

### Message
- **Primary positioning:** "The only skill marketplace you can trust." Lead with trust/verification, not catalog size.
- **Counter PromptBase:** "Skills, not prompts. Versioned, maintained, runnable — not a one-time text download."
- **Counter free registries:** "Free skills have no warranty. SkillMart skills come with proof-of-use, version guarantees, and buyer protection."

### Target

**Confidence Rating by Section:**

| Section | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Battlefield Map | High | Multiple primary sources; comprehensive coverage |
| Comparison Matrix | Medium-High | Some traffic data older than 3 months (PromptBase SimilarWeb); catalog sizes self-reported |
| Deep Dives | Medium-High | Strong for ClawHub (security research); limited independent reviews for SkillHub.club |
| Who's Winning | High | Evidence-backed competitive factors |
| Whitespace | High | Gaps are clearly observable across all competitor profiles |
| Threats | Medium | T-1 (model capability) is structural speculation; T-2 and T-3 are inference-based |
| Action Items | High | Directly derived from evidence |

**Limitations:**
- Traffic data for SkillHub.club, skills.sh, and ClawHub is unavailable — these are new or embedded products without public SimilarWeb profiles. Proxy: GitHub activity and install counts used instead.
- PromptBase's SimilarWeb data is from Sep 2025 (5 months old). MOGE data (Jan 2026) used as supplementary source but may use different methodology.
- No revenue data available for any competitor except PromptBase's commission model. All competitors in the agent-skills space are free/open-source with no disclosed revenue.
- Creator tooling comparison is limited — most platforms don't publicly document their seller analytics features.
- SkillMart is pre-launch, so the comparison matrix compares planned features vs. shipped features. Execution risk is inherent.

| Freshness | 17 | 85%+ sources ≤3 months. Two PromptBase sources at 4–5 months flagged. No >12 month sources used for metrics. |
