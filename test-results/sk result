# COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REPORT: AI SKILL MARKETPLACE COMPETITORS
**Prepared for:** SkillMarket AI Product Research  
**Date:** February 26, 2026  
**Focus:** Six Primary Competitors + Ecosystem Analysis
---
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The AI skills marketplace space is rapidly maturing with six major platforms competing on ecosystem size, security posture, creator economics, and developer experience. ClawHub leads in community scale (5,705 skills) but faces critical security issues. Vercel's skills.sh emphasizes security through Snyk partnerships and has achieved rapid adoption. SkillsMP dominates by indexing breadth (96,000+ verified skills). Smithery.ai differentiates through MCP-specific focus, while monetization-first platforms like Skly.ai and SkillsLLM remain early-stage. The core pain points across all platforms are security validation, creator economics, and skill discoverability.

## TECHNOLOGY STANDARDS & ECOSYSTEMS
### SKILL.MD STANDARD
**What it is:** Open specification for AI agent skills, now adopted by Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, and others.
**Format:** 
- YAML frontmatter (name, description, metadata, license)
- Markdown body (skill instructions)
- Optional: scripts/, references/, assets/ directories
- Supported languages: Python, Bash, JavaScript (implementation-dependent)
**Progressive disclosure:** Skills load metadata first, full instructions only when needed (efficient context usage)
**Adoption:**
- **Anthropic:** Claude Code, Claude API
- **OpenAI:** GitHub Copilot, GitHub Copilot CLI, Codex
- **Microsoft:** GitHub Copilot in VS Code
- **Others:** Atlassian, Figma, Cursor, GitHub
- **Cross-platform:** VS Code, GitHub Copilot CLI, GitHub Copilot coding agent, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Aide, Augment, OpenCode
**Advantages:**
- Simple, human-readable format
- Version control-friendly
- Works with any LLM (not proprietary)
- Scalable context management
**Platforms using SKILL.md:** SkillsMP, Skly.ai, skills.sh, ClawHub (uses markdown variant)

### MODEL CONTEXT PROTOCOL (MCP)
**What it is:** Open-source framework by Anthropic (Nov 2024) for standardizing how LLMs integrate with external tools, systems, and data sources.
**Purpose:** Solves data isolation problem - enables AI agents to plug-and-play with tools rather than requiring custom integrations for each data source.
**Key benefits:**
- **Standardization:** One protocol for all tool integration
- **Scalability:** New tools don't require custom code
- **Data access:** Agents can access on-prem databases, cloud systems, distributed tools
- **Plug-and-play:** Server-based architecture (not embedded code)
**Industry adoption:**
- **Supported by:** Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Zed, Sourcegraph, more emerging
- **Implementations:** 200+ MCP servers available (Smithery)
- **Ecosystem:** Growing rapidly (new servers launched weekly)
**Differences from SKILL.md:**
- **SKILL.md:** Embedded instructions + optional scripts (data + code together)
- **MCP:** External servers with defined tools/resources (decoupled architecture)
- **Use case:** SKILL.md for agent instructions; MCP for external system integration
- **Both can coexist:** Skills can use MCP servers as resources
**Why it matters for skill marketplaces:**
- Future-proofs platforms (MCP becoming industry standard)
- Enables richer integrations (external API access vs. local execution)
- Expands skill capabilities (web search, databases, etc.)

## PAIN POINTS & ECOSYSTEM CHALLENGES
### Core Issues Across All Platforms
#### 1. **Supply Chain Security Crisis**
- **Magnitude:** 20-40% of skills contain security flaws; 1-13% confirmed malicious
- **Attack vectors:** Prompt injection (91% of malicious samples), silent exfiltration, reverse shells, credential theft
- **Detection gap:** Traditional security scanners miss prompt injection attacks
- **Root cause:** Low barrier to entry → minimal vetting before publication
- **Platforms affected:** ClawHub (hardest hit), skills.sh (mitigated with Snyk), others (unknown)
**Impact on SkillMarket AI:**
- Enterprise adoption blocked until security model proven
- Regulatory pressure (data protection, IP theft)
- Need for transparent security scanning (Snyk partnership valuable)
**Sources:**
- [Snyk ToxicSkills Study](https://snyk.io/blog/toxicskills-malicious-ai-agent-skills-clawhub/)
- [Prompt Injection Attacks - Systematic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/html/2601.17548v1)
---
#### 2. **Lack of Creator Economics**
- **Problem:** Most platforms are free-only; no monetization for creators
- **Consequence:** Low incentive for quality skills; brain drain to proprietary platforms
- **Current state:** Only Skly.ai offers paid skills (early stage)
- **Market gap:** Creator-first platforms (e.g., Gumroad for skills) don't exist yet
**Impact on SkillMarket AI:**
- Opportunity to differentiate with revenue-sharing model
- Attract top creators from OpenClaw/GitHub
- Enable sustainable skill development (not side projects)
**Sources:**
- Verified across all competitors' websites (no monetization disclosed)
---
#### 3. **Discoverability & Curation Challenges**
- **Problem:** 270k+ indexed skills; 87-96k verified; which are good?
- **Solutions attempted:**
  - **Leaderboard ranking** (skills.sh by usage)
  - **Search/categorization** (SkillsMP)
  - **AI-based evaluation** (SkillHub: S-rank/A-rank by AI)
  - **Community voting** (stars, comments)
- **Gap:** No unified trust signal across platforms
**Impact on SkillMarket AI:**
- Opportunity: AI-based quality scoring (beyond SkillHub's approach)
- Unified metadata (creator reputation, quality metrics)
- Cross-platform reviews/ratings
---
#### 4. **Creator Analytics & Growth Tools**
- **Lack of:** No platform offers comprehensive creator dashboard
- **Available:** 
  - skills.sh: Install counts (per-skill, per-platform)
  - Others: Minimal analytics
- **Needed:** Download trends, geographic data, upgrade paths, audience insights
**Impact on SkillMarket AI:**
- Creator retention opportunity
- Aggregate analytics (anonymized) valuable for ecosystem health
---
#### 5. **Standard Fragmentation (SKILL.md vs. MCP)**
- **Problem:** Two incompatible standards emerging
- **SKILL.md:** Agent instructions + embedded scripts (Anthropic/OpenAI standard)
- **MCP:** External servers for tool integration (Anthropic standard)
- **Result:** Marketplace fragmentation; skills not portable across platforms
**Impact on SkillMarket AI:**
- Choose standard wisely (recommend SKILL.md for MVP, MCP support roadmap)
- Position as multi-standard marketplace
---
#### 6. **Trust & Quality Control**
- **Models:**
  - **Open:** ClawHub, skills.sh (anyone can publish)
  - **Curated:** Skly.ai (approval-based)
  - **Indexed:** SkillsMP (pulls from GitHub)
- **Tradeoff:** Open = growth but low quality; curated = slow but trustworthy
**Impact on SkillMarket AI:**
- Hybrid model recommended: open publishing + community review + security scanning
- Transparent approval criteria

### Emerging Opportunities
1. **Security as a feature** (not afterthought)
   - Snyk partnership or in-house scanning
   - Transparency about validation methods
   
2. **Creator monetization** (proven business model)
   - Revenue-sharing platform (Skly.ai approach at scale)
   - Subscription for premium creators
   
3. **AI-powered discovery** (better than search)
   - Recommendations based on use case
   - Skill quality scoring (automated)
   
4. **Enterprise governance** (B2B segment)
   - Approval workflows
   - Audit logging
   - Team collaboration tools
   
5. **Skills as-a-service** (outsourced skill building)
   - Commission professional developers
   - White-label for enterprises

**Phase 2 (Series A):** 
- Creator monetization (60/40 split)
- Analytics dashboard
- Target: Professional skill developers, agencies
**Phase 3:** 
- Enterprise features (team approval, RBAC, audit logs)
- MCP support
- Target: Large enterprises (Slack, Figma, Adobe plugin-style model)

## CONCLUSION
The AI skills marketplace space is rapidly maturing with clear market winners and losers emerging:
- **ClawHub:** Lost market leadership due to supply chain compromise (security crisis)
- **skills.sh:** Emerging leader (security + adoption momentum)
- **SkillsMP:** Largest indexed ecosystem (but discoverability challenges)
- **Smithery.ai:** Differentiated (MCP focus + VC-backed infrastructure)
- **Skly.ai:** First-mover in monetization (too early to validate)
- **SkillsLLM:** Unclear positioning (low visibility)
**SkillMarket AI's opportunity:** Combine skills.sh's security rigor with Skly.ai's monetization model, add AI-powered discovery and enterprise features. Position as "secure, creator-friendly, enterprise-ready" marketplace.
**Timeline:** Market is moving fast (skills.sh launch: Jan 2026; security crisis: Jan-Feb 2026). First-mover advantage in creator monetization + security could capture significant market share within 6 months.
