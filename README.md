## Competitive Intelligence Analyzer

Turn **one product spec** (Markdown or plain text) into a **single, auditable competitive landscape report**.

### What it does
- Extracts **Category / ICP / JTBD / USP hypothesis / Key features**
- Discovers **5–10 competitors** (direct + optional adjacent) with clear **“why included”** rationale
- Collects **public, source-linked data** per competitor  
  - **MVP required:** **Similarweb monthly visits** + **X (Twitter) followers**  
  - **Crypto optional:** TVL / volume / audits / chain support (only when publicly available)
- Generates a **Markdown report** with:
  - competitor list + rationale
  - **comparison matrix** (side-by-side)
  - **actionable insights** (advantages, gaps, whitespace)
  - **research TODOs** (missing data becomes tasks)
  - **sources appendix** (URLs + retrieved dates for audit)

### Trust rules (non-negotiable)
- **No fabrication:** if it can’t be verified, it becomes `Unknown`
- **Evidence-linked claims:** every important claim includes **source URL + retrieved date**
- **Conflict handling:** disagreements are flagged as `CONFLICT` and shown side-by-side with sources
