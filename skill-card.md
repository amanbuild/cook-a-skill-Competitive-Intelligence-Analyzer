# Skill Card — Competitive Intelligence Engine

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| **Skill Name** | **Competitive Intelligence Engine** |
| **What it automates** | End-to-end competitive intelligence workflow from a product spec: detects product domain (crypto / SaaS / AI / marketplace), identifies *active* competitors (last 12 months), fetches validated public metrics (traffic, TVL, social, funding, traction), standardizes comparison, and synthesizes strategic insights (threat tiers, whitespace, positioning gaps, action items). |
| **BEFORE: Manual process** | Teams manually search for competitors, check multiple sources (Similarweb, social, token data, news), copy fragmented metrics into spreadsheets, and attempt to compare them without standardized criteria. The process is inconsistent, error-prone, and usually takes **2–3 days** per report. |
| **AFTER: With the engine** | Users provide a product brief (.md). The system automatically executes: domain classification → competitor discovery → metric selection logic → API data fetch (Similarweb, TVL, social) → activity validation (12-month filter) → benchmark matrix → strategic synthesis. Total turnaround: **~5 minutes of automated research + review.** |
| **Core Intelligence Layers** | 1) Domain Detection Layer (crypto / SaaS / AI / marketplace) <br> 2) Metric Selection Engine (context-aware KPIs) <br> 3) Data Fetch Layer (Similarweb API, DefiLlama TVL, X metrics, Web search validation) <br> 4) Activity Filter (exclude inactive projects) <br> 5) Strategic Synthesis Engine |
| **Data Sources** | Similarweb API (traffic & geography), DefiLlama (TVL), X follower metrics, web search (recent updates), funding databases (when available). |
| **Output Structure** | Executive Summary <br> Market Landscape Map <br> Standardized Benchmark Table <br> Competitor Health Tiering <br> Strategic Insights (Threats, Whitespace, Strategic Moves) |
| **Limitations** | SaaS revenue data not be accessible. Social metrics may fluctuate and require validation. Domain misclassification may affect KPI selection if the product spec is unclear. |
| **Expansion Roadmap** | Add competitor health scoring model (weighted KPI system), funding database API integration, caching layer for recurring updates, and dynamic refresh capability for real-time monitoring. Fine-tunning for SaaS category |
